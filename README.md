# ST-Tracker

ST-Tracker (Smart Time Tracker) is a project created by Riccardo Deana and Pierluigi Fabbro for the course "Laboratorio didattico di ingegneria dell'informazione" taught by professor Riccardo Bernardini of the University of Udine.
ST-Tracker is a device capable of keeping track of the time taken up by daily activities and making the acquired data available to the user by connecting via WiFi with his PC or Smarthpone.
In this repository you can find all the code necessary to reproduce the device. All the necessary information is available on the project website.
